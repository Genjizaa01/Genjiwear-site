    <h1>Return & Refund Policy</h1>
    <p>Because most of our products are made to order, we do not hold inventory. We want you to love your purchase and will do our best to make things right. Please read our policy carefully before making a purchase. This document is for general information and is not legal advice.</p>

    <h2>Return Eligibility</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Defective or misprinted items:</strong> If your item arrives defective, damaged or with a printing error, contact us within 14 days of delivery with your order number and clear photos of the issue. We will gladly replace the item or issue a refund.</li>
      <li><strong>Size exchanges:</strong> We accept size exchanges on apparel within 14 days of delivery. Items must be unworn, unwashed and in their original condition. You are responsible for return shipping costs unless the item is defective.</li>
      <li><strong>Incorrect or damaged shipments:</strong> If you receive the wrong item or it arrives damaged in transit, let us know promptly so we can arrange a replacement at no additional cost.</li>
      <li><strong>Non-returnable items:</strong> Gift cards, digital downloads and custom or personalized products are non-refundable except as required by law. Digital files that are defective or corrupted will be reissued or refunded upon verification.</li>
    </ul>
